# Dresser photos

I saw their picture today
and I wondered what your life
was like. If they spoke to you
like I did. What special
moments you shared. The
secrets you knew and
they knew.

I almost shared it with
you. And asked you what
they were like, but I
saw you. Through the window
playing with Dutchess.

And you were smiling
and I could see the life
in you. And I could see
you were there.

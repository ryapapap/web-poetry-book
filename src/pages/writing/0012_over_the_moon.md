# Over the moon

You know,
if you asked me for the moon
I might be able to swing it.
There's this guy out in...
I think it was Nebraska
trying to sell real estate out there.
Says he owns the whole thing through some loophole.

I probably can't get him to part with all of it,
but, you know, we could save up.
Get a nice lot with a view.

Or maybe we could visit instead.
I think it'd be a lot cheaper if we wait for a while.
I can start doing the research, you know,
so we'll be ready.

Or maybe it's enough to see it.
I know a place.
Really feels like the moon is all there is.
Lighting up the whole sky.
Glowing something fierce.
It isn't full right now
but I'm sure it's nice enough.
We could go.

Or there's this other place I know.
Far from here,
where there's enough stars
you might not even notice the moon
and we can just feel
small,

small.

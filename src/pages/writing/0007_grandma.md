Come here, my child. Oh, I have so much to give. Won’t you please share this meal with me? Now, now, that is not enough. Eat. No, no, my child, _eat_. But, you see, that is not enough. I have so much to give. Please, _please_ take this. I can’t let you leave with out this, sweetie. It is good for you, take it. Yes, that’s right. Have some more. What a sweet child. Yes, yes, take it. More. But I have more, child. I have more.

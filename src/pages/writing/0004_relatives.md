# Relatives

I saw it on a street sign
and it was familiar enough
to make me wonder where
I knew it from.

And then I remembered.

It had been months
if not years since I had thought of you.

It is often like that,
when I am reminded.
it was almost enough
to have forgotten.

But not this time.
Not yet.

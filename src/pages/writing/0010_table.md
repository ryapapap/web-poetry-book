# Table manners

We sit at a table across from one another. We are sitting in silence. I can hear many things. Forks hittings plates. Food being chewed. Waiters bussing tables. The low mumble of conversation happening elsewhere. They are distant. Outside of us. The lighting is dim and your face is obscured. You are uninterested.

I am trying to find something to say. My mouth is growing heavy. It sits agape. It cannot form words. Suddenly, time slows. You are frozen and the table begins to grow. It keeps growing until I have left the restaurant, until I can no longer see the restaurant. It is growing faster and slowly I am leaving Earth. I am in space. It is dark.
